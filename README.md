# Ecommerce-Upgrade

## Description

In the event that a manager of an internet retail company reaches out to me in the future, I wanted to create an application that would allow for an e-commerce website to use the latest technologies. That way the company could could compete more with its competitors in the market. I accomplished this by running code on my VSC through node js and my terminal, allowing for an individual client to access online databases and add data from their personal computers. Through completing this application, I gained a better understanding of how to incorporate mysql in real life systems, how to route adding and receiving data from the database through js files, and using the insominia tool. I hope this will prepare me for the future for when real clients ask me for websites that require data incorporation.

## Installation

Install node js on VSC, and then make dotenv, express, mysql2, sequelize dependencies. Also requires Insomnia application for viewing.

## Usage

The client will first rune the their VSC with node.js, and then open their terminal to mysql. They will create a new database and start using it. Afterwards, move over to the terminal for the server.js file, and seed the files with data so the database has figures to work with (assuming the files and routing has already been setup). One will then run the application, and open the local host url in their insomnia. They will look at the current data using /categories, /products, and /tags, depending on the area they are working on. Just viewing the data will require a GET inut before the URL. To add to the database, POST. To update one of the data, use PUT. And if one needs to get rid of one of the data, DELETE. Once all data is settled to the user's liking, just close the application and shut down the server for next time.
